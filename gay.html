				<h3>History behind the LGBTQ+ Movement</h3>
				<p>People who've identified as LGBTQ+ have struggled with oppression for centuries. Gay marriage was illegal in Australia until the 9th of December 2017, when the legislation decided to make same-sex marriage legal. Gay had become a commonly used term in society to describe something as "foolish, stupid or unimpressive." Putting down, and holding exclusion and unacceptance towards the LGBTQ+ society.
				</p>
				<h3>LGBTQ+ Movement, when it began.</h3>
				<p> 
					LGBTQ Rights movement had begun in 1969, where Stonewall riots had become a major turning point for LGBTQ+ rights. Organizations that had dedicated to promoting rights within the community had began in the 1920s. Some examples were The Society for Human rights, which was formed in 1924, and the Mattachine Society, formed in 1950.</p>
