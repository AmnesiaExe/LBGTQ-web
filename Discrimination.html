						<h3>What is Discrimination?</h3>
							<p> Discrimination is the prejudicial treatment of people and groups/communities based on characteristics such as sexual orientations, gender, or race. There are many factors that influence discrimination. Research shows that the people who discriminate are influenced by their, culture, sociological trends, community, and family beliefs. Culture influences how and whether you consider feelings. Social influence involves intentional and unintentional efforts to change a person's beliefs and behavior. Family influences include coercive interactive patterns in which a parent influences their child’s behaviour or beliefs towards something.</p>

				<h3>What are the different types of discrimination?</h3>
					 <p>The people who are being discriminated against are people with a different sexual orientation other than straight. There are 4 types of discrimination that can be used: direct discrimination, indirect discrimination, harassment, victimization. Direct discrimination is when someone treats you worse/differently compared to others because of your sexuality. Indirect discrimination occurs when an organisation has a particular policy that applies to everyone but puts people with a different sexual orientation at a disadvantage. Harassment is when someone makes you feel offended, humiliated, or degraded. Victimisation is where you are treated badly because you made a complaint or sexuality related discrimination under the equality act. It can also occur to someone if they are supporting someone who has made a complaint.</p>

Have a support group, having a couple of people that you feel safe talking to about private matters. Stand up for yourself, let others know that their words have affected you and make people aware that a problem exists. You can also do some practices to help calm you down such as meditation or something that will build up your mental toughness.</p>
